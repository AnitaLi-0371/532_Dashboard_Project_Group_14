## Description of app & sketch

This app shows the key factors that may contribute to employee attrition based on IBM HR analysis data. Four factors (`monthly income`, `business travel frequency`, etc) are chosen to show the distribution by attrition status using box plot and bar charts. From a dropdown list, users can filter out `job role` and/or `department` because these factors may have different degree of impacts on attrition.  Checkbox and scroll bar allow users specify `gender` and/or range of `age` of emplyees based on their interests. By exploring the distribution charts and different variable options, users will be able to compare which factors are driving employee attrition, and hopefully these finding will be beneficial to users so that they can develop employee retention strategies to reduce attrition rate.
