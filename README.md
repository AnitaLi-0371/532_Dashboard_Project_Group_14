## Description of app & sketch

This app shows the 4 key factors that may contribute to employee attrition based on IBM employee satisfaction survey data. The 4 key factors (`monthly income`, `business travel frequency`, etc) are showed with the distribution by attrition status using box plot and bar charts. From a dropdown list, users can filter out `job role` and/or `department` because these variables may have different degree of impacts on attrition.  Checkbox and scroll bar allow users specify `gender` and/or range of `age` of emplyees based on users' interests. By exploring the distribution charts and different variable filter options, users will be able to look into the impact of these factors on attrition and identify potential high risk employee segments, and hopefully these finding will be beneficial to users so that they can develop employee retention strategies to reduce attrition rate.
